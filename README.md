🧰 Tech Stack:
- ☕ Java 17
- 🌱 Spring Boot 3.x
- 📬 RabbitMQ (Messaging)
- 🛡️ Resilience4j (Observability)
- 🧪 JUnit 5, 🎭 Mockito (Testing)
- 🗄️ In-memory store (no persistent DB)
- ⚙️ CI/CD via GitHub Actions

---

📬 Messaging  
This service **only listens** to RabbitMQ messages on the `admin.notify` queue.

- Logs received notifications in-memory  
- Receives messages forwarded from `recruiter-service`, including those triggered by candidate actions

🔍 Endpoints:
- `GET /admin/messages` – View messages  
- `DELETE /admin/messages` – Clear all messages

---

🧪 Testing  
Uses JUnit 5 and Spring’s `@WebMvcTest`.  
CI powered by GitHub Actions.

✅ What’s Covered
- GET /admin/messages  
- DELETE /admin/messages

---

⚙️ Concurrency & Transactions  
This service is passive:
- No @Transactional methods  
- No database persistence  
- Uses a thread-safe in-memory store

---

📊 Resilience4j Observability  
Supports:

✅ Circuit Breakers  
🔁 Retry Policies  
⏱️ Rate Limiting  

Actuator endpoints (not exposed publicly):
- /actuator/resilience4j.circuitbreakers  
- /actuator/resilience4j.retries  
- /actuator/resilience4j.ratelimiters

🧪 To test locally:
- Provide valid environment variables  
- Or switch to H2 using `.env.local` / `application-local.yml`

---

📘 Pagination  
Not applicable — all messages are returned at once from memory.

---

⚠️ Deployment Note on Cold Start Behavior (Render)

QuickHire+ is deployed on [Render](https://render.com).

When inactive for some time, services may enter a **"cold" state**, resulting in:

- Initial request latency (10–30s) as services spin up
- Temporary 502/504 responses until startup completes

🧪 To trigger warm-up manually:
- Open Swagger UI or hit a simple `/health` or `/actuator/info` endpoint
- Wait a few seconds for services to fully boot
